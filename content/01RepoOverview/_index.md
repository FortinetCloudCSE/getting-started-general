## Introduction

The aim of these documents is to help developers get started developing in the FortinetCloudCSE GitHub Organization. This organization hosts various workshops, POCs, and other code developed and maintained by the FortinetCloudCSE team.

## Layout

These documents begin with high-level overviews of Git and various workflows for creating new repos as well as cloning and forking existing repos. Overviews of Docker and several CI/CD tools that are part of the FortinetCloudCSE development workflow are then covered. We also cover getting started deploying official sample Fortinet architecture IaC templates.

## Links

The organization repos are located here: [FortinetCloudCSE GitHub](https://github.com/FortinetCloudCSE).

There are also official Fortinet repositories holding infrastructure as code that can be used in deploying sample architectures and POCs here: [Official Fortinet GitHub Repositories](https://github.com/fortinet/)
