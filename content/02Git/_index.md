Git is a popular and widely-used version control system and integrates directly with GitHub for team repo maintenance and collaboration. Git workflows can get pretty complex, and the purpose of this document is not necessarily to take one from zero to Git hero, but instead to provide an overview of simple workflows and Git commands that can be used for branching and pushing code and working with repositories.

If you'd like to dive deeper into Git, the official documentation can be found here: [https://git-scm.com/docs](https://git-scm.com/docs)

Atlassian also provides a series of very accessible tutorials here: [https://www.atlassian.com/git/tutorials](https://www.atlassian.com/git/tutorials)

### First Steps

It is recommended to use SSH keys for authentication rather than username/password credentials. Here are some useful articles on getting started working
with SSH keys and Git:
